CHANGELOG FreeSection

PREAMBLE 2008-06-18
FreeSection is a derivate of SmartSection 2.13. SmartSection was originally made by SmartFactory (www.smartfactory.ca) and published under the GNU licence. Although the creation of a derivate is permitted by the GNU General Public License (GPL), the creation of FreeSection is not necessarily endorsed or supported by the SmartFactory.

FreeSection is not a fork and at this moment, the creator of this derivate has no plans to make it a fork. It is simply great to have a clone readily available that has no hidden text links.
