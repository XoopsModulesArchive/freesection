How can I clone this module ?
=============================

Cloning this module has never been easier ! Thanks to our friend Sudhaker, you can now painlessly clone this module as many time as you like !

- Locate and edit the file extra/clone/clone.php.

- Locate these lines and change the second part of each line for what you need :

$patterns = array(
  // first one must be module directory name
  'freesection'  => 'mysection', 
  'FREESECTION'  => 'MYSECTION',
  'FreeSection'  => 'MySection',
  'Free Section' => 'My Section',
  'FSECTION'      => 'MSECTION',
  'Freesection'  => 'Mysection' 
);

In this example, FreeSection will be cloned into MySection

- Save and close clone.php.

- Move clone.php file to the root of your web site.

- Be sure to have uploaded the smartpartner folder in the "modules" folder of your site.

- if your site is a local site on your computer, go to yoursite.com/clone.php.

- if your site is on the web, run this command php -q clone.php 

- Delete the file yoursite.com/clone.php

- You can also edit the language constants defined in smartparter/language/ to reflect the new purpose of the module.

- You can also edit the image images/module_logo.png to avoid confusion with the original module.
